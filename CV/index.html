    <h2 class="w3-text-black">Professional Experience</h2>
    
    <p><strong>October 2018 - Present:</strong> The Berlinguette Group, Department of Chemistry, UBC.</p>
    <p>Postdoctoral Research Fellow – I develop spectroscopic tools to optimise thin film materials and fabrication techniques on a
robotic materials discovery platform under construction. I liaise with a variety of engineers and computer scientists in the
operation and design of the robotic platform as well as assisting PhD students in their experimental design. I help organise the
subgroup concerned with the investigation of solar energy materials on the robotic platform.</p>
  
    <p><strong>2018-2019:</strong> Laboratory of Organic Photovoltaics (LMPO), CEA Grenoble</p>
    <p>Research Engineer (working in French) – At the CEA I optimised flexible perovskite solar cells focusing on encapsulation
procedures as part of the European consortium, APOLO. I carried out full device processing, encapsulation and testing. This
has allowed me to meet all my project milestones to date in device efficiency and lifetime. Additionally, I established weekly
research group meetings with PhD students, interns, technicians and my supervisor to maintain communication within the
research group.</p>
  
    <p><strong>2014 - 2018:</strong> Prof. Neil Greenham, Optoelectronics Group, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge.</p>
    <p>PhD Student in solution processed semiconductors – I independently developed my research projects; designed experiments;
produced inks and nanoparticle suspensions and optoelectronic devices; characterised thin films; and participated in local and
international collaborations. My PhD resulted in four first author publications as well as several other publications from
collaborations. Further, I was the daily supervisor for several project students, which required me to communicate difficult
procedures and complex ideas to undergraduates and masters students.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Spring 2014:</strong> Prof. Jeremy Baumberg, Nanophotonics Group, University of Cambridge</p>
    <p>Master’s project – I carried out an investigation into the laser heating effects of nanoparticle slurries. This required me to work
with high powered lasers (on the order of 10 W) as well as develop skills in automated data acquisition.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Summer 2013:</strong> Prof. Andrew Huxley’s research group, University of Edinburgh</p>
    <p>Internship – I worked in close contact with a PhD student and a post-doctoral researcher to design the control software for a
microscope being built in the laboratory.</p>
    <p><strong>Summer 2011:</strong> Prof. Ulf Leonhardt’s research group, University of St Andrews</p>
    <p>Internship – In St Andrews, I carried out a ray tracing investigation into propagation of light through media with complex
refractive indices.</p>
    
    <h2 class="w3-text-black">Education</h2>
    <p><strong>PhD:</strong> Optoelectronics Group, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge, 2014 – 18. Effects of Low Temperature and
Structure on the Photophysics of Alkylammonium Lead Halide Semiconductors, supervised by Prof. Neil Greenham.</p>
    <p><strong>MSci - First Class:</strong> Experimental and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge 2013-2014. Majors: Advanced Quantum Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Condensed Matter Field Theory, Atomic and Optical Physics</p>
    <p><strong>BA - First Class:</strong> Experimental and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge 2010-2013. Majors: Quantum Condensed Matter Physics, Optics and Electrodynamics, Advanced Quantum Mechanics</p>
    <p><strong>Scottish Advanced Highers:</strong> The Berwickshire High School, 2004-2010. Chemistry (A), Maths (A), Music (A), Physics (A).
    <h2 class="w3-text-black">Languages</h2>
    <p> English: Native </p>
    <p> French: Fluent </p>
  <h2 class="w3-text-black">Teaching</h2>
  <p><strong>2015, 2016, 2017:</strong> Daily supervisor for Masters students and PhD students on placements.
This required me to submit research proposals for 8 week projects. These resulted in work which provided foundation data for
    published articles.</p>
  <p><strong>2015, 2016, 2017:</strong> Workshop for around 10 PhD students on renewable energy pathways. I was required to write and present
the workshop as part of the Centre for Doctoral Training in New and Sustainable Photovoltaics at the University of Cambridge.</p>
  <p><strong>2016, 2017:</strong> Laboratory demonstration for the Centre for Doctoral Training in Nanotechnology, demonstrating PV device
    characterisation with a solar simulator and scanning electron microscope.</p>
  <p><strong>2015:</strong> Weekly tutorials for first year physics undergraduates for Girton College, University of Cambridge. This required setting
  and marking weekly problem sets, as well as aiding to develop understanding.</p>
